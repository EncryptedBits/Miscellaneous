# IMAGE ENHANCEMENT, RESTORATION AND INPAINTING

This project is developed by me as Exploratory project during IV semester. This project is all about the enhancement, restoration and inpainting of a dull or deteriorated image. This project implements many low-pass and high-pass filter with different restoration techniques. This also implement a inpainting technique that can modify a image having some deteriorations such as cracks, to an image without any cracks.
